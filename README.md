# Sinatra Films Lab

## MVP

  - Use the solution to your weekend homework (or use our solution). Add a controller and views to render a list of all the films in an unordered list.

  **As a user I want to visit localhost:4567/films and see a list of films**

  - Make the film titles **anchor** tags that link to a view of the individual film details.

## Further

  - You're going to add a stylesheet to the app. In order to do this you'll have to create a **layout.erb** in your views directory.

  - Use Sinatra's **layout.erb** and **<%= yield %>** to create a side-wide template and apply a stylesheet to your app. Can you use CSS to remove the bullet points from the list of films and centre them in the screen?

  - BONUS: Use a colour palette to find good colours that work together (https://coolors.co)
